            Iâ€™m a software developer based in Gurugram, IN. Iâ€™ve spent the past
            3 years at startup, freelancing and working on side products.
            <br />
            <br />
            Iâ€™m probably the most passionate developer you will ever work with.
            I've been programming ever since I was in school, though I came to
            it from a different career path of photography.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've shown my love for coding in many ways. I was the head of the
            hackathon team in college. I have been to several hackathons across
            the country and won two of them. I also guide young students and
            provide them with the roadmap to become a better Software engineer.
